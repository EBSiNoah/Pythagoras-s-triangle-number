Pythagoras's triangle number

I try multiple repeat to find out them.
First, as a common way, I repeat each value until the end.
Second, to reduce reiteration, I use some formula.
(a,b,c) = (m^2 - n^2, 2*m*n, m^2 + n^2)
But, both results are different. This is my next things to figure out.

The reason of different result between common way and Formula is because condition of b value in formula.
As a natural number, b is always mutiple of 2. That is why both results are different.
Next, I make a vector which has index as same as length of each side of triangle and value as same as square of them, so I don't need to calculate every loop.
But this method is also needs long times, so exit condition is most important to reduce time. 
There are three exit conditions.
First, maximun length range of side c is 50 and its square is 2500. Value of a^2+b2 should not over it.
Second, set start loop point value of c at next of the b and if a^2+b^2<(b+1)^2 is true, we don't need to loop up next c value.
Third, when you find out correct value then exit.
Those conditions less the times.
